### Prerequisites

You will need the following to use this starter:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Java DK](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A)
- A Firebase project created in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)

## Setup Guide

Clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/codebusters-ca/react-firebase-starter.git`

Install the dependencies:
`cd .\react-firebase-starter\ && npm run setup`

At this point, the client side should work. You can launch it with:
`npm start`

### Firebase Setup

You may have noticed that data isn't yet being fetched from Firebase. We need to connect a Firebase project to make it work.

In [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com), enable Firestore Database and Authentication via Google.

Back to your code editor, open a new terminal. Log into Firebase CLI:
`cd .\react-firebase-starter\ && firebase login`

Start connecting your Firebase project:
`firebase init`
and follow the prompts. **When asked if you'd like to overwrite `firestore.rules`, choose 'No'.**

This project is set up to use Firestore, Functions, and Emulators. Make sure you choose these options when prompted by Firebase CLI. Similarly, when asked about which emulators you want to use, choose Auth, Firestore, and Functions.

Now that we've initialized the local Firebase directory, let's connect it to your project.

Run `firebase projects:list` and copy the ID of the project you want to use.

Then tell Firebase CLI to use that project:
`firebase use <your project ID>`

Head over to `/src/firebase.clientApp.js` and add your config object (found in Firebase Console under Project Settings).

Finally, run Emulators with `npm run emulators`. Head over to the browser ([localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)) and see `Hello from Firestore Emulator` appear there.

Congratulations! The setup process is now complete.

## Usage

### Build

`npm start`

### Test

`npm run emulators`
In another terminal: `npm test`

You should see a list of 3 tests that all pass.

### Deploy

`npm run build`
